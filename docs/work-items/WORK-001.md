# WORK-001 Evidence — Repository, modular-monolith and governance foundation

Status: IN REVIEW — implementation complete on `work/WORK-001-foundation`; PR open; architect review and merge pending.

## Requirement mapping

WORK-001 owns no frozen requirement IDs directly (substrate/governance Work Order per `spec/work-orders/WORK-001.md`). Acceptance criteria are mapped instead:

| Acceptance criterion | Implementation | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Strict TypeScript/Bun toolchain, deterministic commands | `package.json` (exact-pinned devDependencies, canonical scripts), `tsconfig.json` (strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `verbatimModuleSyntax`), `biome.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, committed `bun.lock`; CI workflow repaired so the toolchain gate is executable | `tests/integration/toolchain-contract.test.ts`; CI `implementation` job (activates via the repaired toolchain-detection gate) |
| 2. Module skeleton + public/internal boundary convention | 18 modules under `src/modules/*` with `public.ts` + `domain/ application/ ports/ adapters/ internal/`; `src/integrations/workflowos/`; typed `ModuleDescriptor` in `src/shared/module.ts` | `tests/architecture/module-skeleton.test.ts`; `tests/unit/modules.test.ts` (spec §6 sync) |
| 3. db, Redis, object-store, clock, crypto, secret-store ports without domain coupling | `src/platform/{db,redis,object-store,clock,crypto,secret-store}/port.ts` (+ `config/port.ts`, `db/migrations/` home); ports are interface-only; domain/application/ports layers are forbidden from importing platform | `tests/architecture/dependency-direction.test.ts`; `tests/discrimination/dependency-rules.discrimination.test.ts` (domain-coupled-to-platform cases) |
| 4. Architecture/dependency tests rejecting cross-module internal imports and out-of-adapter SDK imports | Rule engine `tests/architecture/lib/dependency-rules.ts` (13 rules incl. `internal-never-cross-module`, `cross-module-public-only`, `provider-sdk-outside-adapter`, undeclared-import fail-closed) + SDK boundary table | `tests/architecture/dependency-direction.test.ts`; `tests/architecture/provider-sdk-boundaries.test.ts`; discrimination proofs in `tests/discrimination/dependency-rules.discrimination.test.ts` |
| 5. Fresh clone runs governance validation without application source | `scripts/governance-check.py` unchanged and source-independent; tracked-file copy (clone-equivalent) validated | `tests/integration/fresh-clone-governance.test.ts`; `tests/discrimination/governance-gate.discrimination.test.ts` (gate rejects mutated state) |

## Implementation

- Base revision: `463e6a677630cdc3cae5914abc01aafdd154c795` (`main`)
- Implementation revision: `17a3ce0` (branch head; stable binding identity is PR #3 below; final identity is the architect merge commit recorded at post-merge finalization)
- Changed surfaces:
  - `src/platform/` — ports (config, db, redis, object-store, clock, crypto, secret-store) + migrations home
  - `src/api/` — transport-only placeholder contract
  - `src/shared/` — module descriptors, canonical error taxonomy, UUIDv7 primitives
  - `spec/development-state/` — WORK-001 marked in-flight (program/frontier), checkpoint outcomes recorded (evidence-only, verdicts pending)
  - `.github/workflows/governance.yml` — repaired pre-existing workflow defect: the `implementation` job gate used `hashFiles()` in a job-level `if`, which is not a valid location (job conditions are evaluated by the Actions service, which has no workspace). Every workflow run since PR #1 merged failed at composition with zero jobs (run named by file path instead of workflow name) — the governance gate was silently dead. Replaced with a `toolchain-detection` job whose output feeds `needs.toolchain-detection.outputs.present` — same gate semantics (implementation runs only when `tsconfig.json` + `bun.lock` exist), now valid. Both behaviors (skip without files, activate with files) were empirically validated against GitHub's real workflow parser in a throwaway repo before applying.
  - Toolchain root files directly required by acceptance criterion 1: `package.json` (devDependencies added; scripts unchanged), `tsconfig.json`, `biome.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `bun.lock` (new)
  - `src/modules/*`, `src/integrations/workflowos` — module skeleton created per acceptance criterion 2 (`IMPLEMENTATION.md` §2 layout)
  - Tests/evidence directly required by the Work Order: `tests/{unit,architecture,discrimination,integration}/**`, this evidence file
- Changed files: 141 added/modified, 0 removed — 18 module skeletons ×6 files, 8 platform port/README files, 3 shared primitives, 11 test files, 5 toolchain files, 3 development-state files, 1 evidence file
- Not touched: frozen architecture (`spec/architecture.md`, `spec/architecture-lock.md`, ADRs), `spec/contracts.md`, all other Work Orders, `scripts/governance-check.py` (verified byte-identical to base)

## Verification

Commands run with Bun 1.3.4 (the CI-pinned version) on the branch head:

- CI (GitHub Actions, run 33281490675 on `17a3ce0`, `pull_request` event): all three jobs green — `governance` (governance-check.py), `toolchain-detection` (files present → gate open), `implementation` (Bun 1.3.4 setup, `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, typecheck, lint, architecture tests, unit tests, integration tests — every step success). This is the first green workflow run in the repository since the `implementation` job was introduced.
- Governance check: `python3 scripts/governance-check.py` → `Governance OK: 20 Work Orders, 45 requirements, frontier=[]` (exit 0)
- Deterministic install: `bun install --frozen-lockfile` → no changes, 53 installs across 102 packages (exit 0)
- Typecheck: `bun run typecheck` → exit 0 (TypeScript strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess)
- Lint: `bun run lint` → exit 0 (Biome, 137 files, no findings)
- Unit tests: `bun run test:unit` → 20 passed (3 files): UUIDv7 (format/uniqueness/monotonicity/counter/clock-regression), error taxonomy spec-sync vs `spec/contracts.md`, module registry spec-sync vs `spec/architecture.md` §6
- Integration tests: `bun run test:integration` → 6 passed (2 files): fresh-clone governance validation, toolchain contract
- Architecture + discrimination: `bun run test:architecture` → 58 passed (5 files): real-tree zero violations, module skeleton completeness, SDK boundary table, 20+ synthetic violation injections all rejected, valid-shape negative control clean
- Real PostgreSQL/Redis: not required for this Work Order — no durable authority boundary, schema, accounting, identity store, idempotency ledger or durable execution state was introduced (see checkpoint scope notes)
- Discrimination/mutation proof: `tests/discrimination/dependency-rules.discrimination.test.ts` (every named boundary weakened and rejected, incl. negative controls) and `tests/discrimination/governance-gate.discrimination.test.ts` (governance gate rejects hand-edited frontier, deleted lock artifact, dependency mismatch, merge-evidence-before-complete)
- Concurrency/crash proof: not applicable yet (no concurrent durable state); monotonic/clock-regression safety of UUIDv7 proven in `tests/unit/ids.test.ts`

## Checkpoint evidence

Applicable blocking contracts from `spec/governance/checkpoint-contract.json`:

- `IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETENESS` — acceptance criteria 1–5 each implemented and mapped to passing tests (table above); full verification gate green.
- `IDENTITY-IDEMPOTENCY` — scope note: no durable authority boundary introduced; frozen idempotency contract untouched (`spec/contracts.md`); `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` present in canonical taxonomy; UUIDv7 identity primitives proven.
- `CONCURRENCY-CRASH-SAFETY` — scope note: no concurrent durable state introduced; UUIDv7 generator proven monotonic under same-millisecond and clock-regression.
- `SELF-HOSTING-BOUNDARY` — no second authority created; worker did not merge its own PR; governance gate proven discriminating against state corruption; fresh-clone validation proven.
- `DEPENDENCY-DIRECTION` — rule engine over the real tree reports zero violations; every rule proven discriminating via synthetic mutation.

Recorded in `spec/development-state/checkpoint-state.json` as worker-recorded outcomes with verdicts pending architect review.

## Known limitations

- No runtime dependencies exist yet by design: `src/` currently contains ports and skeleton only; adapters (PostgreSQL, Redis, object store, Fastify transport, provider SDKs) arrive with the Work Orders that own them. The SDK boundary table is therefore exercised by synthetic discrimination tests, not by live SDK imports.
- Architecture tests are deterministic static scans; they do not replace the dynamic boundary tests that later Work Orders must add at real authority boundaries.
- `spec/work-orders/WORK-001.md` still reads `Status: PENDING` because `spec/work-orders/` is outside this Work Order's declared surfaces; program-state carries the authoritative in-flight status.
- The pre-existing CI defect is fixed in this PR (see Changed surfaces). Every workflow run between PR #1's merge and this PR failed at workflow composition with zero jobs, so no CI check actually executed against `main` in that window — worth an architect finding for the merged-but-broken window.
- `bun.lock` was generated with Bun 1.3.4 exactly (the version CI pins); `--frozen-lockfile` verified.
